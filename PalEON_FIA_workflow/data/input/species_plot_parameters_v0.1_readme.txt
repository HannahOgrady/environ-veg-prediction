DESCRIPTION: 
This is the density calculated by Sean DuBois for individual FIA spcd in each FIA plot.

********
HEADER:
spcd: FIA species code. To see the list of species and codes go to Appendix F of the FIADB User Guide.
      These species codes can be converted to PalEON level tree names using the FIA_conversion-SGD_remove_dups.csv conversion table from the FIA GitHub repository: https://github.com/PalEON-Project/PalEON-FIA/blob/master/Conversion_tables/FIA_conversion-SGD_remove_dups.csv 	

plt_cn: The plot record number. This number matches the "CN" column from the FIA Plot table. According to the FIADB User Guide: "Sequence number. A unique sequence number used to identify a plot record." Use this value to match the unfuzzed/unswapped coordinates to the plot. Note that this number is very long and is represented in R and excel in scientific notation. For example, the first entry with spcd 126 has plt_cn 9.361177e+12. That plt_cn is 9361177020004 if you convert to number in the excel csv.

dbh: average diameter at breast height in centimeters of all the individual trees

basal area: sum of the basal area (meter squared per hectare) for all trees of each spcd

n: number of trees of each species in the FIA plot

density: stems per hectare of each tree spcd in the plot
